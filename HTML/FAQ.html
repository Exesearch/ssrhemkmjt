<!--A series of FAQs and their answers.-->

		<h4>I'm lost! Please help.</h4>
	Well, do we have a surprise for you: Google maps is an excellent tool for
	finding one's way! Alternatively, we have a map of the campus
	posted at the bottom of the page, complete with labels indicating names of
	buildings. <br><br>
	... On a serious note, if you do need immediate help, call the campus Estate
	Patrol on 01392 723999. In an emergency, call 999.
	<br><br><h4>What on Earth is ExeSearch?</h4>
	ExeSearch is a treasure hunt game designed to help you
	find their way around campus and meet new people! Receive clues to follow and
	tasks to complete in order to find your way to some
	special treasure! Neat, huh?
	<br><br><h4>How do I play the game?</h4>
	Once you log in, you will be told what group you are in and any ongoing games.
	Meet up with everybody on your team, hit "Ready", and then you'll be able to
	start! You can also see current progress on a game by clicking "View progress".
	<br><br>Once you've started a game, you'll be set all the challenges
	you'll need to complete to reach the end of the treasure hunt. Answer the
	question correctly, and you'll be given a clue leading you to a location
	on campus. You will need to walk to that location, then click the button to
	check your position. If you are in the right location, you will be given a
	task to do. This repeats until you have completed the game.
	<br><br><h4>Why am I even playing this?</h4>
	Hmmm, ask your tutor? They'll know... Probably.
